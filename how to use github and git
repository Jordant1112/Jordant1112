Move changes from local repository to GitHub

1). Go to Terminal, head to the specific destination of the project in git hub repository

To browse what is in the repository:
* ls (list the files)
* git log --oneline  (shows you every commit made step by step)
* git branch (the star is at the current working branch)   
        for example:        Red_screen
                            clock
                           *master
        it means we are working at the master branch
        
In order to move local repository to the remote repository, we first need to check if we create the remote repository already
* git remote -v (to check if we created)
* git remote add origin 'URL of the repository in github' (to point to a remote repository, origin here is the name of the pointer)
use git remote -v to check if it is added

In order to push the changes of repository to github
* git push -u origin master (telling git to push all changes from master branch into the origin (remote repository))
#### Refresh Github you will see the files in github repository

#####################################
Move changes from GitHub to local repository
* git pull origin master (origin and master were created previously)

#####           Collaborating with team members         ####
############################################################

Go to Settings -> Manage access -> invite a collaborator

As a collaborator: 
* git clone 'URL from github' 
will give you access of the project
then cd 'file name' and commit changes

* open 'file'.py and make changes
* git status (it will show you the modified file, untracked file)

##############
need to add and commit and push the commit locally to remotely

* git add .
* git commit -m 'information for description'
* git push -u origin master

## Fork
Copy the project of others to be owned under my account
after that we can clone it from the URL

## add a readme.md file to the project 
*echo 'sentences to be written into the readme file' > readme.md
* ls
* git add .
* git commit -m 'added a readme file'

check the remote
* git remote -v
* git push -u origin master
You will see the modification in my account of that project copied


## Pull Request
If we want to make changes of the project owned by others, 
after the commit to our github repository, we can click on   
Pull request 

## Merge


git checkout 'another branch' (ways to change working brance)
